      <h2>Multiplication and Division</h2>
      <p>
        Multiplication and division are fundamental mathematical operations that
        involve combining and separating numbers. These operations are used to
        solve real-life problems and make calculations more manageable.
      </p>
      <h3>Multiplication</h3>
      <p>
        Multiplication is the process of adding a number to itself multiple
        times. It is represented using the '×' symbol or by simply placing
        numbers together. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> 3 × 4 = 12
      </p>
      <p>
        This means you add 3 to itself 4 times to get the result of 12.
      </p>
      <h3>Division</h3>
      <p>
        Division is the process of splitting a number into equal parts. It is
        represented using the '÷' symbol. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> 12 ÷ 4 = 3
      </p>
      <p>
        This means you divide 12 into 4 equal parts, and each part is 3.
      </p>
      <h3>Using Multiplication and Division</h3>
      <p>
        These operations are used in various situations. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Area Calculation:</strong> To calculate the area of a
          rectangle, you multiply its length by its width.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sharing Items:</strong> When you share items equally among
          friends, you are using division.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repeating Tasks:</strong> Multiplication is used to determine
          the total when a task is repeated several times.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Practicing Multiplication and Division</h3>
      <p>
        You can practice multiplication and division with exercises and
        real-life problems to strengthen your math skills. Remember to use the
        order of operations (PEMDAS) to correctly solve complex problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        These operations are building blocks for more advanced mathematics,
        making them essential for everyday life.
