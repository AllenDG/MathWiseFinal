      <h2>Exponents (Powers and Roots)</h2>
      <p>
        Exponents are a mathematical notation used to represent repeated
        multiplication or division of a number by itself. They come in two main
        forms: powers and roots.
      </p>
      <h3>Powers</h3>
      <p>
        A power is a way of showing how many times a number should be multiplied
        by itself. It is represented using a base number and a small raised
        number called an exponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example 1:</strong> 2<sup>3</sup> = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
      </p>
      <p>
        In this example, 2 is the base, and 3 is the exponent. It means that 2
        should be multiplied by itself three times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example 2:</strong> 5<sup>2</sup> = 5 * 5 = 25
      </p>
      <h3>Roots</h3>
      <p>
        A root is the opposite of a power. It helps find the original number
        when given the result of repeated multiplication. The most common root
        is the square root.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> âˆš16 = 4
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that the square root of 16 is 4 because 4 * 4 = 16.
      </p>
      <h3>Practicing Exponents</h3>
      <p>
        Exponents are used in various areas of mathematics and science, such as
        calculating areas, volumes, and scientific notation. Understanding
        exponents is essential for solving complex mathematical problems and
        equations.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can practice exponents by solving exercises and problems that
        involve both powers and roots. It's a valuable skill for both everyday
        calculations and advanced math.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that exponents follow the order of operations (PEMDAS), so
        be sure to apply them correctly when solving math expressions.
