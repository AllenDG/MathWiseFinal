      <h2>Addition and Subtraction</h2>
      <p>
        Addition and subtraction are fundamental mathematical operations used
        to combine and separate numbers. They are used in everyday life for
        various calculations and problem-solving.
      </p>
      <h3>Addition</h3>
      <p>
        Addition is the process of combining numbers to find the total or sum.
        It is represented using the '+' symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example 1:</strong> 3 + 4 = 7
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that when you add 3 and 4 together, you get a total of 7.
      </p>
      <h3>Subtraction</h3>
      <p>
        Subtraction is the process of taking one number away from another to
        find the difference. It is represented using the '-' symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example 2:</strong> 9 - 5 = 4
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that when you subtract 5 from 9, you have a difference of 4.
      </p>
      <h3>Using Addition and Subtraction</h3>
      <p>
        Addition and subtraction are used in various situations. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Counting:</strong> Addition helps in counting items or
          adding numbers together.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Change Calculation:</strong> When you receive change after a
          purchase, subtraction is used to calculate the amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Word Problems:</strong> Real-life word problems often involve
          addition and subtraction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Practicing Addition and Subtraction</h3>
      <p>
        You can practice addition and subtraction through exercises and everyday
        tasks. These operations are building blocks for more complex
        mathematics, so it's important to master them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that addition and subtraction follow the order of
        operations (PEMDAS). You should perform them from left to right.
      </p>
      <p>
        By understanding and practicing addition and subtraction, you'll
        improve your math skills and be better equipped to handle various
        calculations.
